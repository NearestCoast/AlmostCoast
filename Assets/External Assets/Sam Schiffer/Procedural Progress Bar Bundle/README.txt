Thank you for purchasing the Sam Schiffer Procedural Progress Bar Bundle!

If you already added the bundle assets to your library, you can download and import them now from the Package Manager!

- Procedural Health and Progress Bars: https://u3d.as/2XdK
- Procedural Circular Health and Progress Bars Pro: https://u3d.as/2jpc

The "Procedural Progress Bar Bundle" asset itself does not need to be imported, and you can safely remove it at any time.

If you haven't added these assets to your library yet, do so by going to their respective asset store pages and purchasing them (0.01$ each)
